# nfisis_thesis

This repository contains the source code used for the simulations in my Ph.D. thesis.

The root directory contains simulation scripts named according to the time series used. For example, [01_MackeyGlass.py](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/nfisis_thesis/blob/ae0b27feaaba2b442db9bf5693183d9d37ecf261/01_MackeyGlass.py) contains the simulations for the Mackey-Glass time series.

Hyperparameter Optimization

Standard Models: A grid search is performed to identify the best hyperparameters.

Deep Learning Models: A random search approach was implemented. These simulations are hosted in a separate repository: [RandomSearchDL_Thesis](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/RandomSearchDL_Thesis.git).

[Datasets](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/nfisis_thesis/tree/ae0b27feaaba2b442db9bf5693183d9d37ecf261/Datasets) Contains the photovoltaic (PV) energy datasets.

[Functions](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/nfisis_thesis/tree/ae0b27feaaba2b442db9bf5693183d9d37ecf261/Functions) Includes utility functions used to generate synthetic time series.

[Model Summary](https://github.com/kaikerochaalves/nfisis_thesis/tree/ae0b27feaaba2b442db9bf5693183d9d37ecf261/Model%20Summary) Summaries of the architectures for selected proposed models.
